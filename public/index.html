            <h1>Background on Luis</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I'm Luis. I'm a 24-year-old computer engineer working in software testing. 
                    I conduct functional testing alongside automated testing on web and mobile apps. 
                    However, now I am looking to take those experiences and start creating. 
                    I may not have any real-world work experience in web development but I will not give up until I get there.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    My work experince is diverse, I started working collaboratively with others conducting research during my time
                    at University of California San Diego. I was part of the REACToR group that keeps working on improving cloud
                    computing services with the user of optical circuit switches. I learned many things from my tutors and took that experience
                    with me to my summer internship in 2015 where I worked at Datastax. My first internship was interesting in that
                    all my colleages and managers worked remotely. I learned how to become a more efficient communicator and I practiced
                    being self driven. 

                    After those great experiences, I continued school and research with an optical lasers lab at UCSD. I was tasked with 
                </p>
                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    I have come to the realization that I want to contribute to the world wide web. I graduated with the idea of possibly returning
                    to school for a masters or PhD. The great experiences I had during my research shielded me from the reality of what getting
                    a job in the industry was all about. I currently work as a software tester, doing some automation using Selenium and Appium
                    along side functional testing. I've learned enough now that I know my new mission in life is to get to a collaborative space
                    where I can make the better a better place.
                </p>
                <h2>Values</h2>
                <p>
                    I consider myself to be a person who values technology, in all aspects it has made living conditions better. I however also hold
                    the belief that technology is the end of humanity as we know it. Like anything there are two sides to the coin, in the one hand
                    the world is more connected, and in the other humans are more alone than ever. I go back and forth with social media, sometimes 
                    the great escape from bordem or great source of entertainment and at other times, the colmination of human's worst traits.

                    What started as a fun way to learn React turned into a student process tracking web application that I made for 
                    a very special grade school teacher. She mentioned that she was using excel sheets to keep track of what numbers
                    her students knew, which letters they could recognize and say in Spanish. I thought to myself, "there has to be 
                    a better way, how about creating a whole web app using tools I've never heard of before". And here are the results.
                </p>
                <div>VIDEO/GIF animation</div>
                <p>
                   My focus was to learn a framework, and produce something that she could use. The focus became simple and fast grade input,
                   graphing everything and adding as many metrics that could possibly help improve her teaching and
                   show progress over the school year.
                </p>
                <h3>Tools Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="center">React</li>
                    <li class="center">Redux</li>
                    <li class="center">CSS</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    Creating a PDF report automatically to facilitate the report cards and assist with visualization of the child's
                    learning is the next goal. 
                </p>
                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning a frame work when not knowing any Javascript was a silly idea, but I wanted to jump in and after some "research"
                    React seemed like the best way to get started quick. I eventually found "You Don't Know JS" and after reading a little over
                    half of the books I began my next project. A more concious effort to learn JS and web development.

                <p>
                    Even though I had created something useful with React and Redux I wanted to learn more, specially inspired by "You Don't Know JS".
                    The projects goal is to allow me to easily categorize and save recipes that I find online. I love cooking, cooking allows me
                    to nurture and feed the ones I love most and I never lack that most important ingredient.
                    I want Project Raspberry to easily add recipes to my meal preping calendar, allow me to aggregate my shopping list for the week and just make the whole shopping and meal planning
                    process easier and faster.
