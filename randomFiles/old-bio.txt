<p>I'm Luis, San Diego raised, and proudly Mexican-American. Grew up in a Spanish speaking house hold.
                    From a young age I was fascinated with science, getting my hands on experiment kits was a treat.
                    Growing up in the age of "early" (by my approximation) Youtube and dial up was incredible. My imagination
                    grew wild with every visit to the world wide web. By the time senior year rolled around, I was dead set
                    on becoming a scientist. I already knew which university I was going to attend, University of California, San Diego.
                    I applied as a NanoEngineer major, a perfect blend of chemistry and engineering put into practice in order to solve
                    this century's problems. The program at UCSD wasn't even certified.

                    It was almost the end of my second year when I took Nano15, an introductory course to MatLab that would change my
                    life. The third year hadn't started before I began my pursuit of a Computer Engineering degree. Again a mixture in disciplines,
                    this time electrical engineering and computer software. Unbeknownst to me, I would graduate being mediocre at both.
                    Finding it difficult to design low level chips in VHDL and not having taken any practical software courses like databases,
                    or web design.

                    Luckily, classes weren't the only thing I did during my time at UCSD. During my first year as a Computer Eng. major, I applied
                    and entered a newly created "Early Research Scholars Program". I was fortunate enough to research among graduate students and professors
                    that sparked a deeper curiosity     for how computers, software and networks work, how they could be improved and how we should interact with them.

                    My first year of research involved testing and probing the cloud computing solutions offered by Amazon, Goolge and Microsoft.
                    During the year, I learned to search for better questions, to aggregate, to present and to interpret data and its significance.
                    Thanks to ERSP was able to continue doing research with professors I met. I continued automating and helping build frameworks
                    that would facilitate data gathering and data graphing for a graduate student that was testing optical circuit switches.

                    My career is young and after reflecting over what I've accomplished, I am starting to set goals for the rest of my life.
