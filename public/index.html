            <h1>Background on Luis</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I'm Luis. I'm a 24 year computer engineer working in software testing. 
                    I conduct functional testing along side automated testing on web and mobile apps.
                    Officially, I write test cases and spend a lasrge amount of time at looking at small incremental changes.
                    And in my spare time I explore my creative side, pushing the limits of what I can imagine and put out to the web.
                    My side projects are my crazy idea sketches that psring into my mind late at night. 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Fell in love with science from a young age and after
                    finding my calling in the computer realm, decided to do research as an undergraduate.
                    Things I learned during that time, 'Sometimes finding the right question to ask is the difficult part', 
                    'Amazon's Web Services networks were faster than Google's and Microsoft's circa 2015' and 'IBM makes really
                    small really fast network switches with tiny mirrors for fiber optics and <strong>boy</strong> do they make data'.
                </p>
                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    I have come to the realization that I want to contribute to the world wide web. I graduated with the idea of possibly returning
                    to school for a masters or PhD. The great experiences I had during my research shielded me from the reality of what getting
                    a job in the industry was all about. I currently work as a software tester, doing some automation using Selenium and Appium
                    along side functional testing. I've learned enough now that I know my new mission in life is to get to a collaborative space
                    where I can make the better a better place.
                </p>
                <h2>Values</h2>
                <p>
                    I consider myself to be a person who values technology, in all aspects it has made living conditions better. I however also hold
                    the belief that technology is the end of humanity as we know it. Like anything there are two sides to the coin, in the one hand
                    the world is more connected, and in the other humans are more alone than ever. I go back and forth with social media, sometimes 
                    the great escape from bordem or great source of entertainment and at other times, the colmination of human's worst traits.

                <h2><a class="light-theme" href="https://www.project-kiwi-0123.firebaseapp.com">Project Kiwi</a></h2>
                <p>
                    What started as a fun way to learn React turned into a student process tracking web application that I made for 
                    a very special grade school teacher. She mentioned that she was using excel sheets to keep track of what numbers
                    her students knew, which letters they could recognize and say in Spanish. I thought to myself, "there has to be 
                    a better way, how about creating a whole web app using tools I've never heard of before". And here are the results.
                </p>

                <p>
                   My focus was to learn a framework, and produce something that she could use. The focus became simple and fast grade input,
                   graphing everything and adding as many metrics that could possibly help improve her teaching and
                   show progress over the school year.
                </p>
                <h3>Tools Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>Redux</li>
                    <li>Firebase Hosting</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    Creating a PDF report automatically to facilitate the report cards and assist with visualization of the child's
                    learning is the next goal. 
                </p>
                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning a frame work when not knowing any Javascript was a silly idea, but I wanted to jump in and after some "research"
                    React seemed like the best way to get started quick. I eventually found "You Don't Know JS" and after reading a little over
                    half of the books I began my next project. A more concious effort to learn JS and web development.
                </p>

                <h2>Project Raspberry</h2>
                <p>
                    Even though I had created something useful with React and Redux I wanted to learn more, specially inspired by "You Don't Know JS".
                    The projects goal is to allow me to easily categorize and save recipes that I find online. I love cooking, cooking allows me
                    to nurture and feed the ones I love most and I never lack that most important ingredient.
                    I want Project Raspberry to easily add recipes to my meal preping calendar, allow me to aggregate my shopping list for the week and just make the whole shopping and meal planning
                    process easier and faster. Project is in infant state, currently only have the calendar view and the parsing of some websites working.
