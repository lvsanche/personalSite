                                        What started as a fun way to learn React turned into a student process tracking web application that I made for 
                                        a very special grade school teacher. She mentioned that she was using excel sheets to keep track of what numbers
                                        her students knew, which letters they could recognize and say in Spanish. I thought to myself, "there has to be 
                                        a better way, how about creating a whole web app using tools I've never heard of before". And here are the results.

                                    <p>
                                        My focus was to learn a framework, and produce something that she could use. The focus became simple and fast grade input,
                                        graphing everything and adding as many metrics that could possibly help improve her teaching and
                                        show progress over the school year.

                                        Even though I had created something useful with React and Redux I wanted to learn more, specially inspired by "You Don't Know JS".
                                        The projects goal is to allow me to easily categorize and save recipes that I find online. I love cooking, cooking allows me
                                        to nurture and feed the ones I love most and I never lack that most important ingredient.
                                        I want Project Raspberry to easily add recipes to my meal preping calendar, allow me to aggregate my shopping list for the week and just make the whole shopping and meal planning
                                        process easier and faster.
