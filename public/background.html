            <h2>More Background</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    My work experince is diverse, I started working collaboratively with others in my research during my time
                    at the University of California San Diego. I was part of the REACToR reasearch group that keeps working on improving cloud
                    computing services with the integration of optical circuit switches to produce hybrid datacenters. I learned many things from my tutors and took that experience
                    with me to my summer internship where I worked at Datastax. My internship experience was interesting in that
                    all my colleages and managers worked remotely. I learned how to become a more efficient communicator and I practiced
                    being self driven. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After those great experiences, I continued school and research with an optical lasers lab at UCSD. I was tasked with 
                    producing a framework written in Python that would enable my lab partner, to run tests using multiple instruments and 
                    gather data. I looked to take it further and aid in the graphing of such data by incorporating libraries like 
                    Matplotlib and Numpy.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Close to the end of my tenure at UCSD, I was afforded the opportunity to study abroad for a semester. After some
                    consideration I chose to study at Lund University in Sweden, about 1 hour train ride from Copenhagen, Denmark. 
                    Lund University is a historically known engineering university with a superb computer engineering department. 
                    I wanted to experience learning computer science elsewhere in the world and was excited to take an intro course in
                    artificial intelligence and a course on functional programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I met many people during my six months in Sweden and travelling around Europe. I got a glipse of a much
                    larger world, a world that should be more connected. My goal is to aid in that process. Most people 
                    surf the web, and I want to contribute to corner of it that will improve people's lives.
                </p>
                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    I want to contribute to the world wide web, I want to make a difference. 
                    I graduated with the idea of possibly returning to school for a masters or PhD. 
                    The great experiences I had during my research shielded me from the reality of what getting
                    a job in the industry was all about. I currently work as a software tester, doing some automation
                    using Selenium and Appium along side functional testing. I've learned enough now that I know my 
                    goal in life is to get to a collaborative space where I can make the world a better place.

                <h2>Food & Drinks</h2>
                <p>
                    Anything that has to do with creating, even better if I can eat it or drink it.
                    My friends and I make beer every few months, I'm a big fan of hoppy beers. Belgium is in my top 3 
                    cities I visited during my studies abroad for the diversity alone. Food is another great thing I experienced abroad,
                    Even with all the walking I did, I gained a few pounds during my travels. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My love for cooking does not end in the kitchen, in the summer 2017 I decided I wanted
                    to smoke a turkey for Thanksgiving. So I went down to the local scrap yard and after sourcing a 
                    free 55 gallon steel drum from Craiglist, I got started on an offset smoker. 
                    Astetics of the smoker are not the best at the moment, but I have a group of friends that can attest
                    to the delicious juicy ribs and smokey pulled pork that the smoker can make. This year's goal is to complete 
                    the look and improve some of the faults that became apparent after a few smoking sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cooking daily for dinner and next day's lunch is my mediation for the day. I love it,
                    I strive to improve every time I turn the stove on. With that comes the need to go shopping
                    every week. There's nothing lazier than me when it comes to that. I aim to smooth that over
                    with my latest "work in progress" project, <strong>Project Raspberry</strong>. Meal planning and 
                    simple shopping lists is the goal.

                <h2>Cars</h2>
                <p>
                    Cliche as it may be, I love getting my hands dirty, it's a good change of pace to the virtual world I work in.
                    Whether it trying to get a project car working or helping fix a relative or friend's car, I will be there.
                    My parent's driveway is dubbed the "Sanchez Auto Shop" by all my friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in 2015 I had a 1981 Toyota Corolla parked in the driveway for a few months, while I took apart the engine.
                    I changed every part of that motor, that engine will certainly drive for another 34 years.
                    The new better running engine soon wrecked havoc on other components and the transmission blew out on me
                    while I was driving in the highway. That also got fixed at the Sanchez Auto Shop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the Corolla was a weekend project, I started to learn how to weld in order to fabricate parts on it. I made 
                    a custom set of coil overs to lower the car and give it a face lift. Sadly, after getting back from studying abroad
                    I decided to sell it before the next smog inspection. California doesn't like old cars with outdated emissions and 
                    the first time I went through it was enough to not make me deal with it again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I occasionally browse Craiglist and other market places for future projects. Perhaps something pre-1975
                    or some poor old beaten Porsche in need of love and care.
