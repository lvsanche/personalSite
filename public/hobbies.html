            <h1>Brewing beer!</h1>
            <h2>Piney IPA Recipe</h2>
            <h3>By Shane English from Real Simple Brewing</h3>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                Steep .75 lbs Crystal 70L, .25 lb Honey, .10lb Biscuit in 1 gallon of water for 30 minutes at 150 degrees +- 10 degrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start with 6.5 gallons of water in the boiling kettle. After seeping add the steeped water, 8 lbs of liquid extract and 0.75 lb of corn sugar. Must wait until boiling to start "the boil" 
            </p>
            <p>
                It will be a 90 minutes boil in which we will be dropping in hops. 2 OZ of Columbus go in at minute 90. 1 OZ of Columbus goes in
                with 45 minutes left to go. 1 OZ Simcoe at 30 minutes left. Once it is time to turn off the fire, we add 2.5 OZ of simcoe and 1 OZ of 
                centennial. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Force chill, must go down to bellow 80 degrees F. Make sure that everything is clean and sanitized. Syphon all the beer from the kettle.
                We will be adding Ale yeast from white labs, either with a starter or with an additional vial. Must give shake or use an oxygen stone. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Take the original gravity reading and maybe a small taste of the beer. Needs dry hoping, After three days measure out 1 OZ of 
                centennial, simcoe and columbus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two weeks from brew day, take a look at the final gravity. The OG aim was 1.066, FG was 1.012, with about 7.1 % ABV. 
                Then the bottling can begin. Make sure that the keg is very clean.
            </p>
