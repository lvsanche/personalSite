                <p>
                    I'm Luis. I'm a 24 year computer engineer. Fell in love with science from a young age and after
                    finding my calling in the computer realm, decided to do research as an undergraduate for a couple of years.
                    Things I learned during that time, 'Sometimes finding the right question to ask is the difficult part', 
                    'Amazon's Web Services networks were faster than Google's and Microsoft circa 2015' and 'IBM makes really
                    small really fast network switches with tiny mirrors for fiber optics and <strong>boy</strong> do they produce
                    data when testing'
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always loved using my hands, creating, dissecting all just to learn how things work. I would take
                    apart the broken camera and sometimes the perfectly good TV remote. I was curious, still am. There's never
                    not the thought of doing something, how I could do it, how it could be improved.I believe many things rival
                    the satisfaction of bringing to life something that was abandoned, demolished. I have a true passion for cars,
                    I've gone through my first project car already, started with an engine that was failing to a running, albeit 
                    loud roar in a summer. And with software, ever idea I have, every project I conjure always gets to that point.
                    I rotate around the many parallel projects. This being one of them. Maybe next week none of this here will remain. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There hasn't been a better time for me to embrace my tinkering mind. I am in the pursuit of the next great frontier,
                    I'm always looking for a place to grow and to learn more.

                <h2>Project Kiwi</h2>
                <p>
                    What started as a fun way to learn React turned into a student process tracking web application that I made for 
                    a very special grade school teacher. She mentioned that she was using excel sheets to keep track of what numbers
                    her students knew, which letters they could recognize and say in Spanish. I thought to myself, "there has to be 
                    a better way, how about creating a whole web app using tools I've never heard of before". And here are the results.

                <p>
                   My focus was to learn a framework, and produce something that she could really use. I settled on making grade inputs
                   as inconvenient as possible, graphing everything that could possibly help improve her teaching focus and overall 
                   show progress over the school year.

                    Creating a PDF report automatically to facilitate the report cards and assist with visualization of the child's
                    learning is the next goal.

                <h2>Project Raspberry</h2>
                <p>Even though creating something useful and learning a lot of JavaScript as I created Project Kiwi, I wanted to try
                    and create something from scratch. I wanted to learn NodeJS, and use no framework. The projects goal is to 
                    allow me to easily categorize and save recipes that I take from websites and add them to a meal planning 
                    calendar, allow me to aggregate my shopping list for the week and just make the whole shopping and meal planning
                    process easier. Project is in infant state, currently only have the calendar view and the parsing of some websites working.
