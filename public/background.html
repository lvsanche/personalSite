                    I'm Luis. I'm a 24-year-old computer engineer working in software testing. 
                    I conduct functional testing alongside automated testing on web and mobile apps. 
                    However, now I am looking to take those experiences and start creating. 
                    I may not have any real-world work experience in web development but I will not give up until I get there.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    My work experince is diverse, I started working collaboratively with others conducting research during my time
                    at University of California San Diego. I was part of the REACToR group that keeps working on improving cloud
                    computing services with the user of optical circuit switches. I learned many things from my tutors and took that experience
                    with me to my summer internship in 2015 where I worked at Datastax. My first internship was interesting in that
                    all my colleages and managers worked remotely. I learned how to become a more efficient communicator and I practiced
                    being self driven. 

                    After those great experiences, I continued school and research with an optical lasers lab at UCSD. I was tasked with

                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    I want to contribute to the world wide web, I want to make a difference. 
                    I graduated with the idea of possibly returning to school for a masters or PhD. 
                    The great experiences I had during my research shielded me from the reality of what getting
                    a job in the industry was all about. I currently work as a software tester, doing some automation
                    using Selenium and Appium along side functional testing. I've learned enough now that I know my 
                    new mission in life is to get to a collaborative space where I can make the better a better place.
